Webull Trading Bot
Description

This Webull Trading Bot is a Python-based automated trading system designed to operate on the Webull platform. It utilizes technical analysis to make trading decisions, focusing on support and resistance levels to determine buy and sell points.

Tech Stack

The Webull Trading Bot is built with a range of technologies and libraries:

    Python: The core programming language used for developing the bot.
    Pandas: Utilized for data manipulation and analysis, particularly for handling financial time series data.
    Matplotlib: Employed for creating visualizations of the trading strategies, including support and resistance levels.
    Trendln: A library used for calculating and plotting support and resistance trends in the market data.
    Paho MQTT: An MQTT client library, which might be used for handling real-time messaging or notifications.
    NumPy: Used for high-level mathematical functions and multi-dimensional arrays.

These libraries and technologies work together to provide real-time trading capabilities, technical analysis, and the necessary computational efficiency.
Features

    Automated Trading: Executes buy and sell orders based on calculated support and resistance levels.
    Real-time Data Processing: Streams real-time market data for accurate and timely decision-making.
